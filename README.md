# Nodegrams (WIP)
A node-base programming environment written in C++11
Basically like [Pure Data](https://puredata.info) but with higher focus on scripting custom nodes

Target goals:
* Cross-platform
* Lightweight and efficient - for using as multi-purpose service or integrating into bigger systems
* Modular - chose what you need and the scripting environment(s) you like
